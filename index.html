<h3>We will be without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for our next domestic fixtures - but Sokratis says there's no cause for concern. </h3>
<body>
<div>
Our club captain received a straight red card following a VAR review at Selhurst Park, as we held on to secure a hard-earned point against Crystal Palace.

But Sokratis says Alex Lacazette has all the qualities to step up in Auba's absence.
</div>
<q>He’s a machine, a goal machine,</q> the Greek defender said. <q>He’s a very good player. In some games, from the outside, you can’t see what he can do. Or maybe he is a little bit struggling. But we have see also how is the game and which guy he has behind him.</q>

<q>I think he is a very good player, we are with him every time, he is with us and we will show all together in the future a lot of things.</q>

<q>I think Laca is coming better and better. He’s very important, a massively important player for us. Altogether we have to improve, to step up and to show that the year is not finished and that we have to fight for this.</q>
